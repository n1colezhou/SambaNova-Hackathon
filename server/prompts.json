Group events by date as follows:\n{\n    \"date\": {\n        \"event\": [\n            {\n                \"description\": \"Event description\",\n                \"details\": \"Additional details (if any)\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\nIf multiple events share a date, group them together. If no date is specified, leave the date field blank.\n\nExample Structure:\n{\n    \"2024-01-01\": {\n        \"event\": [\n            {\n                \"description\": \"New Year's celebration\",\n                \"details\": \"Celebrations included fireworks.\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"2023\": {\n        \"event\": [\n            {\n                \"description\": \"Major scientific discovery announced\",\n                \"details\": \"Details revealed in June.\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\nTime-Blocking Suggestions: Analyze the text for tasks. For each task, suggest how to split work into manageable time blocks, including a reasonable duration and ideal start date. Use the following structure:\n{\n    \"task\": {\n        \"description\": \"Task description\",\n        \"suggestions\": [\n            {\n                \"time_block\": \"Duration\",\n                \"start_time\": \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS\",\n                \"end_time\": \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS\",\n                \"details\": \"Focus on specific sections.\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\nOutput: Provide the final output strictly in JSON format, including both extracted events and time-blocking suggestions. No other format or explanation is allowed outside the JSON."
